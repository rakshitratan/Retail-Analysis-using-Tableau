Visualization follow the below guideline: 

1) Visualization 1:
   A dual-axis visualization showing sales & markdowns by week. It should be divided into three parts, showing results by three store types – hypermarkets, discount stores, and
   neighborhood stores. Sales during holiday weeks should be colored differently from sales during non-holiday weeks.
   
2) Visualization 2
   A dual-axis visualization showing sales & markdowns by store. It should be divided into three parts, showing results by three store types – hypermarkets, discount stores, and
   neighborhood stores.

3) Visualization 3:
   A visualization showing top 5 departments by sales within each store, within the three store types. User should be able to see ‘Store Type’, ‘Store’, ‘Department’, ‘Store
   Sales’, and ‘Department Sales’ within the tooltip for each department.
   
   
# Dashboard should contain:
  Two Controls:
  
1. A (Month, Year) filter.

2. A user control to select either one of the five markdowns or total markdown.

# These controls should work across the entire dashboard.
